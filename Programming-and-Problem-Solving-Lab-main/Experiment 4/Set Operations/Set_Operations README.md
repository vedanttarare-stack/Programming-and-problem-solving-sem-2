## Problem Statement
Write a Python program to perform union, intersection and difference operations on Set A and Set B.
---

## Algorithm
1. Start.  
2. Declare two sets A and B
3. Read elements of Set A from the user
4. Read elements of Set B from the user
5. Perform Union operation
   Union = A ∪ B.
6. Perform Intersection operation
   Intersection = A ∩ B.
7. Perform Difference operations
8. Difference1 = A − B.
9. Display Set A and Set B
10. Display Union, Intersection, and Difference results
11. Stop
